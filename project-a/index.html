              We have found out that Mr. Hungry wears a hat from the Northern craftsmen which is very interesting 
              because there is no way he can go that far with his abilities. From the locals we heard a myth about a 
              rabbit whos called the great magitian has lost his hat for a long time ago to a someone and that someone has been cursed eternally with hunger.
