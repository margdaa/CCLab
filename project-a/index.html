                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Mr. Hungry is most often found in the lily filled clearings of the forest, especially near market stalls or anywhere fruit is within reach. He seems drawn to places where the air smells of apples. When not chasing snacks, he can usually be found dozing beneath a broad leaf, perhaps dreaming of feasts that never end.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>He looks almost like a frog, round and squishy. He has a fancy hat. Nobody knows why the hat has a hole in it or why he is always hungry.</p>

                  While exploring the flower-speckled forest near the old market, I stumbled upon a peculiar being now referred to as Mr. Hungry. Small, round, and oddly expressive, he followed my every movement as if expecting food or trouble. What caught my eye most was the pointed purple hat perched on his head, clearly made by Northern craftsmen. How he obtained it remains a mystery, a creature his size could hardly travel that far.
The locals recently shared news about The Great Magician Rabbit, who only days ago lost his enchanted hat during a performance gone wrong. They claim whoever took it was struck by a curse of endless hunger. Judging by the way Mr. Hungry dove headfirst into a basket of apples (and later at my lunch), I fear the curse found its newest victim.
I’ll continue to observe him carefully, and with a generous supply of snacks. </span>
              
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Mr. Hungry reacts instantly to movement, especially anything resembling food. He can be guided with the cursor, which he follows eagerly in hopes of a snack. Avoid sudden motions; he startles easily but quickly returns to chase whatever moved.

 The small white creature, however, is calm and obedient use your cursor to move it freely. Always interact gently. Remember: if he’s moving toward you, he’s not attacking—he’s just hungry.
